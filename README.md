# Transfer Learning with Intel Image Classification

The Intel image classification dataset is a collection of images used for training machine learning models to recognize and classify different scenes. The dataset contains about 25,000 images in a 150 x 150 shape and it is categorized into six classes: Buildings, Forest, Glacier, Mountain, Sea, and Street. Each image in the dataset is labeled with its corresponding class, making it a valuable resource for machine learning models. The diversity and quality of the images in the dataset make it suitable for developing robust models capable of accurately identifying various natural scenes.
The images are split into training, testing, and prediction sets for building and evaluating models. For our analysis, the dataset was split into 14,034 images for training and 3,000 images for testing.
